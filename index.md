Hello 안녕하세요 こんにちは 你好
Here is **SangJun Park**.<br>

I am a master's student at KAIST, supervised by [Prof. Sang Kil Cha](https://softsec.kaist.ac.kr/~sangkilc/).

My research focuses on developing program analysis systems, particularly in the areas of software engineering and cyber security.
I am especially interested in fuzzing, program analysis, and automatic bug finding.
